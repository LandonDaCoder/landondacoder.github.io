     This is a list of my current systems graciously donated by my friends. 

1. My workhorse laptop, a Dell Inspiron 17r 5720. The current specs are: Intel® Core™ i3-3110M, 6.0GB of DDR3 SO-DIMM memory. 
2. My custom built gaming PC, currently rocking an AMD FX-6300 with 16GB of DDR3 and an Nvidia Geforce GTX 1650 graphics card. 
3. An HP/Compaq Elite 8000 SFF Desktop PC with an Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 and 8GB of DDR3. 
4. My little Lenovo H505s, with an AMD Vision E2 APU and 8GB DDR3. This system runs my current firewall and Opnsense router. 
5. My Dell Dimension 4300s with a Pentium 4 clocked at 1.6 GHz with 256mb of PC-133 memory. It has a floppy drive (3.5 inch 1.44mb :p).        
6. An HP 2000 Notebook PC, which has a 15 inch display and an AMD A6-5200 APU, and for memory it has 8GB of SO-DIMM DDR3. It currently runs Fedora 40 (like my Dell
and my gaming PC)
7. A libre computer board AML-S905x-CC. This little board got me into Linux to begin with. It has 2GB of memory and an ARM CPU. It runs off of a 32GB micro SD card.
8. The renegade board from the same people as number 7 (these 2 I bought.) with similar specs and boot media.
